"Producer (also known as *Open Producer*) library originated from the "
"osgProducer utility library in early versions of the OpenSceneGraph toolkit "
"and was later developed into a standalone library.  The osgProducer was "
"eventually replaced by the osgViewer library, and the standalone Producer "
"library became obsolete and is no longer maintained.  For details about "
"OpenSceneGraph usage, refer to the :module:`FindOpenSceneGraph` module."
