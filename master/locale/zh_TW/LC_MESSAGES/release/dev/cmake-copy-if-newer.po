"The :manual:`cmake(1)` command-line tool now supports ``cmake -E "
"copy_if_newer`` and ``cmake -E copy_directory_if_newer`` subcommands to copy "
"files based on timestamp comparison instead of content comparison. These "
"commands copy files only if the source is newer than the destination, "
"providing better performance for build systems compared to "
"``copy_if_different`` which compares file contents."
