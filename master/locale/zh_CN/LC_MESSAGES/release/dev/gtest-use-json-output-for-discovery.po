"The :command:`gtest_discover_tests()` command from the :module:`GoogleTest` "
"module now sets the ``DEF_SOURCE_LINE`` test property for each discovered "
"test if gtest supports the ``--gtest_output=json`` option.  This test "
"property is used by some IDEs to locate the source for each test."

"The :command:`gtest_discover_tests()` command from the :module:`GoogleTest` "
"module previously parsed certain type-parameterized test names incorrectly. "
"Their names ended up with raw characters from gtest's output and were very "
"obviously misparsed.  Those names are now parsed correctly, so projects may "
"see different test names to before for affected tests."
