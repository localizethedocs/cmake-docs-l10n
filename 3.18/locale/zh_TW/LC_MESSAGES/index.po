"CMake is a tool to manage building of source code.  Originally, CMake was "
"designed as a generator for various dialects of ``Makefile``, today CMake "
"generates modern buildsystems such as ``Ninja`` as well as project files for "
"IDEs such as Visual Studio and Xcode."
msgstr ""
"CMake 是一個用於管理來源碼建置的工具。原本，CMake 被設計為各種 Makefile 方言"
"的生成器，如今 CMake 也能生成像 Ninja 這樣的現代建置系統，以及像 Visual "
"Studio 和 Xcode 等 IDE 的專案檔。"

"CMake.  The :manual:`cmake-packages(7)` manual explains how to create "
"packages which can easily be consumed by third-party CMake-based "
"buildsystems."
